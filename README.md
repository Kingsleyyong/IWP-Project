# Pandemonium-19
With the effort of my groupmates, Jamond, Lyn, Koee and Matthew,  we produced a website called Pandemonium-19. We produced this website for our Internet & Web Publishing subject.

In this project, we hope that we can provide some useful information about Covid-19 to all of our users such as the number of cases, where the hotspot is, some story regarding the Covid-19 and many more.
